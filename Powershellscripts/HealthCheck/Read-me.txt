SQL Server Performance Health Check
Usage

Download the ZIP file and copy the "HealthCheck" subdirectory to the desired location.
Open DBList.txt and replace server and database names as required.
For example:
Server1\InstanceA; DB1
Server2\InstanceB; DB2

For servers that don’t have the SQL Browser service enabled, you can specify the port number delimited by a back tick and a comma, as follows:

Server1`,1433; DB1

Execute HealthCheck.bat. The report can be found in the \HealthCheck\Reports directory.
How Does It Work?

The batch file reads a list of SQL Server instance and database names and passes them as parameter values to a PowerShell script, which it executes in a loop, once for each database. The PowerShell script then executes a set of diagnostic T-SQL and PowerShell scripts, exporting metadata to CSV files. Finally, a VBA macro is executed from PowerShell to merge the CSV files into an Excel spreadsheet and then formats the report.

Software Required

The following software is required to run the health check:

PowerShell version 2.0 or higher (comes with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2)
Microsoft Excel 2007 or higher.
SQLPS PowerShell module, which is installed with SQL Management Tools.
Permissions Required

A windows account must be used with the following access to the target server and database:

Server Scope

View Server State
Database Scope

View Definition in target database.
ddl_admin to run DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS if the target server is pre-SQL 2012 SP1, otherwise db_datareader is enough.
Remote WMI access is required to run the ServerInformation.ps1 script. The following article has details on how to grant this access to non-admin users.

If the user does not have the necessary access, the report will still run but will not include the server information worksheet.
