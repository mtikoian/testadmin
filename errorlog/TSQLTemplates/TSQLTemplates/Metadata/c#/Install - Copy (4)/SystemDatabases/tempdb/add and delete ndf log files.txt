DBCC SHRINKFILE with emptyfile option will move the data in the specified data file to another
 data file and empties it. But for Transaction Log files you can not move the data to another file.
 So you have to cleanup the Log by truncating it or by taking a Log Backup. 
Then try the ALTER DATABASE DB REMOVE FILE (file) to remove it.
