2/14/2014 BTB-This version will run against any database that you execute the stored procedure in.  It will provide the count of In_ROW_DATA, ROW_OVERFLOW_DATA, and LOB_DATA, the Scan and Update Patterns for the tables or indexes, Recommend a compression level setting, and provide a description for that setting.

4/22/2014 BTB-This version has the @pageCount parameter.  This is so you can determine what the threshold is for tables you want to compress.  Thanks to Roger Wolter for the Feedback!

5/22/2014 BTB-Added % Compressible and % Uncompressible columns for in order to further highlight how allocation units and their make up of your tables should limit the type of compression that you use.

PARAMETER DESCRIPTION:

@pageCount - Determines the threshold for the number of pages that you want to compress in an object.  If set to 0 will evaluate all tables in a database.

SCRIPT DESCRIPTION:
This script is intentded to take a usage based look at a database and review the objects inside the database and evaluate if they should be compressed or not.  It will evaluate your Allocation Units, Scans, and Updates for objects by partition and will offer a recommendation for compression, which level, and why.
