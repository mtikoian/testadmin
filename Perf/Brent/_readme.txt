## What Is This Stuff?

Hi! You've just downloaded a bunch of free stuff that we hope you find useful.
It's our scripts, setup checklists, e-books, and posters about Microsoft SQL
Server. We built this stuff because we needed it too - we're Brent Ozar
Unlimited, a boutique consulting firm that focuses on making SQL Server faster
and more reliable.

The posters and books are pretty self-explanatory. The scripts are:

sp_AskBrent - "Why is my SQL Server slow right now?" Instructions: http://www.BrentOzar.com/askbrent/

sp_Blitz - "Somebody just handed me a SQL Server. Is it in good shape?" Instructions: http://www.BrentOzar.com/blitz/

sp_BlitzCache - "What are the most resource-intensive queries on this server?" Instructions: http://www.BrentOzar.com/blitzcache/

sp_BlitzIndex - "How could I tune indexes to make this database faster?" Instructions: http://www.BrentOzar.com/blitzindex/

sp_BlitzRS - "Is my SQL Server Reporting Services server healthy?" Instructions: http://www.BrentOzar.com/blitzrs/


## This is Awesome! Can I Give It Away to People?

You can install this on your servers that you manage, like the ones at your
company. There is no charge for using this to make your company's SQL Servers
faster and more reliable. We wrote this to help make your job easier.

However, you can't distribute this to others. This means no installing it on
SQL Servers that your company doesn't own. If you're a consultant or developer
and you'd like to get these tools in use at other companies, you're welcome to
refer those companies to http://www.BrentOzar.com/go/download where they can
get the latest version.

We're not trying to get your customers. We're just trying to stop the problem
of people distributing out-of-date or modified versions of our tools. We work
really hard to build this stuff and give it away for free.
